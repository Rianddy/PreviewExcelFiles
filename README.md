Preview Excel Files
=================

Requirements: The original system used PHPExcel to deal with the Excel files. But it cannot preview the data of large excel files like 500MB due to the huge memory consume. So I need to build a Web Service based on Java to preview scalable Excel files and CSV files. And then store those data defined by users into mysql Database.
